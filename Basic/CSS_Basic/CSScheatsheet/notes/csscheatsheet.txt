3 Methods For Adding CSS
	1. Inline CSS: Directly in the html element (NO! Horrible practice!)
	2. Internal CSS: Using <style> tags within a single document
	                 This is done by putting style tag in the <head> area
	3. External CSS: Linking an external .css file (SUGGESTED!)
			 This is done by using the link tag in the <head> area

Use class or id to target a certain link/element.
	1. ID is usually used for unique elements, meaning it won't appear anywhere else in your html file or you want to target it separately.
	2. Class is used when you want to apply the same style somewhere else in your html file. 
	3. Bootstrap does not use ID, it only has Class.
